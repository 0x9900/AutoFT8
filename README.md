# Auto FT8

AutoFT8 is an experimental project for ham radio operators.

This program automatically controls WSJT-X to optimize contacts' chances during a contest or DX (make as many QSO as possible).

After a receive sequence, the program calculates, using the distance, SNR[^1], and azimuth has the most chances of completing the QSO.
